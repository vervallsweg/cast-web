The version number was just increased to notify useres of the update through the Smartthings app.</p>\n<p>Version 1.2.0 includes some minor bug fixes and new features, like callbacks that are saved in a config file now. See the full changelog <a href=\"https://github.com/vervallsweg/cast-web-api/blob/v1.2.0/changelog.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The major change is the seperation into three different projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>cast-web-api</strong>: the main api itself</li>\n<li><strong>cast-web-api-cli</strong>: it wraps the api and manages it, no need to install forever, etc. just run <code>cast-web-api-cli start</code> or stop/status, etc. takes care of everything, even after reboots</li>\n<li><strong>cast-web-api-desktop</strong>: also wraps and manages the api but is a proper desktop application, for win/mac/linux, just download and install, like any other application</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dbt49k1k0\">How do I update?</h2>\n<p>That depends on your use case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dbt4up3f3\">As easy as possible</h3>\n<p>Great news! There's now a proper desktop application called `cast-web-api-desktop`. Just download and install like any other application, click start and you're all set. See the <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/6\">install guide</a> for more info.</p>\n<p>Make sure to uninstall everything if you are updating.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>npm uninstall cast-web-api -g</code></li>\n<li><code>npm uninstall forever -g</code></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dbt4hrg12\">I'm not scared of the terminal, but as easy as possible please</h3>\n<p>Great news for you too! The new `cast-web-api-cli` package wraps an manages the api and provides, easy, short commands to manage it. All without requiring a monitor or gui, so you can use it headless on a server.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>npm uninstall cast-web-api -g</code></li>\n<li><code>npm install cast-web-api-cli -g</code> <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/21\">node-gyp errors</a> still possible for now</li>\n<li><code>cast-web-api-cli</code> to get the usage guide</li>\n<li><code>cast-web-api-cli start</code> to start the api in the background</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You'll find all the commands in the usage guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dbt4a78k1\">I know what I'm doing in the terminal</h3>\n<p>You guessed it, great news too! If you have found a way to manage the api, that works for you (like forever/pm2), nothing changes. Since the cast-web-api package is the base for all other packages, you'll receive all the updates as usual and can continue using your setup. The update is just an `npm update` away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dbt4hrg12\"> </h3>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dbt4up3f3\"> </h3>",
